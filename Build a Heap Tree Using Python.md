# Ex. No: 15D - Build a Heap Tree Using Python

## AIM:
To write a Python program to build a heap tree using appropriate Python package and function.
---
## ALGORITHM:

1. **Start the program.**
2. Import the `heapq` module.
3. Define a function `heaptree(H)` that takes a list `H` as input.
4. Use `heapq.heapify(H)` to convert the list into a min-heap.
5. Print the created heap.
6. End the program.
---

## PROGRAM:

```
 Import the heapq module
import heapq
def heaptree(H):
    heapq.heapify(H)
    print(f"The created Heap is {H}")
```
